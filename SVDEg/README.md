# Single Value Decomposition Example

## What is it?
[Single Value Decomposition](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SingularValueDecomposition.html)

## Why should we learn it?
It is a powerful tool for compressing images and other information 
with approximation and save storage space.

## What this example illustrate?
It represent the picture with less space needed.

## How does it work?
1. Find the Hurricane Harvey picture from [NASA](
https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/harvey-saturday-goes7am.jpg)
, or any other pics you want to try.
2. Change the import picture name.
3. Numpy will perform SVD on the matrix of that image.
4. PIL.Draw will give you a sense of how much info is preserved.
